# ReviewScraper
A script to scrape businesses from google maps and retrieve their reviews.

# Features
-Scrape business URLs in JSON format based on a search in google maps
-Search for phrases in business reviews
-Save reviews in text file / screenshots

The script only works for the bulgarian language but you can easily replace some
values noted in the code to make it support your language.

I am aware that things like Google places API exist, but I still wanted to do it this way.
Feel free to improve the code as you see fit.
